This repository is for Data Science Tech Institute's Machine learning project. My subject is Project 2, automatic essay grading with machine learning.
The repo contains a jupyter notebook file that will cover the entire project, the databases required for the calculation, as well as a requirements file for dependencies and packages.
Thanks to Assan Sanogo for its guidance during the project.
